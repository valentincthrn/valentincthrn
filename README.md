## My projects

### Project 1 Exploratory Data Analysis and Prediction of the load factor of French wind farms in Python

#### ***Context***

This project was included in our education path in Centrale Lille in a team of 12 students. It was an 18-month project in conjunction with EDF (Énergie De France) and consisted of improving the forecast of consumption and non-controllable electricity production. 
Due to economic and legislative reasons, EDF has to balance its production with its customers' consumption while ensuring maximum production of renewable energies. The gaps are filled on the European electricity market (risk of loss-making sales/negative prices). 

#### ***Our objectives***

The project was mainly exploratory in the sense that even the client gave us a free hand in the search, extraction, and analysis. Concretely, we had to benchmark the weather-related connected object data available on the net. Then, the goal was to collect and analyze a sample of this data. Thus, 3 teams were formed: research, extraction, and analysis. Finally, if the analysis provided was relevant, our client suggested that we look into predicting the load factor of the wind farm.  Thus, in the last two months, the Machine Learning division was created. 

#### ***My achievements***

I was part of two teams: Analysis and then, at the end of the project, Machine Learning where I was appointed leader in both. My main task was to assist our project leader in developing algorithms in Python to analyze the stations extracted by the Extraction division. Finally, I mainly led the development and implementation of artificial intelligence algorithms to predict the load factor of the French wind farm.  The client was very satisfied with the work done and underlined his satisfaction in the prediction results of the Machine Learning team.

### Project 2 : Data Processing in VBA during an 1-month internship

#### ***Context***

During the first year of school at Centrale Lille, a one-month internship is mandatory. After a lot of research, Edmond de Rothschild kindly accepted me to be part of their Asset Management team. This internship was a huge experience for me both personally and professionally. 

#### ***The objective***

In this department, a lot of data from Bloomberg has to be used and analyzed. However, when switching from Bloomberg to Excel, the data is subject to errors or losses. Therefore, an algorithm was used to pre-process this data to clean it up as best as possible. My objective was to improve this algorithm by using the Excel programming language: VBA. 

#### ***My achievements***

Initially, I was a beginner in VBA and also in Finance. So, in 1 month, I wanted to learn as much as possible. That's how I learned and even realized from A to Z this new algorithm in VBA. The team was enthusiastic about my progress and my achievement and assured me to replace the old algorithm with mine. The algorithm was more efficient and faster (about twice as fast). 

#### ***Details***
No data will be available on this Github because of confidentiality.

### Project 3 : Segmentation of bushfires in Python

#### ***Context***

This project is a challenge proposed by the consulting firm EY in collaboration with Forest Fire Management Victoria (Australia) and the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA. Apart from the courses at Centrale Lille which are considered generalist, few electives were oriented around DataScience / Artificial Intelligence, so I was looking for medium-term projects to gain experience. I chose this project in computer vision because it was close to a real use case in an interesting and challenging context.

#### ***The objective***

The goal is to use airborne infrared linescan supplied by Forest Fire Management Victoria (Australia) and satellite data supplied by the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA to help tackle climate change and the fight against bushfires in Australia by using **segmentation**. The solutions from the Challenge will help to reduce fatalities, damage, and trauma by allowing fire authorities to answer critical questions, such as whom they need to warn and what locations need to be evacuated.

#### ***My achievements***

After more than 2 months of projects, I have developed a "UNet" model to do image segmentation. I realized image augmentation thanks to "Albumentations" to reach an F1-score of 0.67, which places me 13th on the challenge.

#### ***Details***
Details will be available at the end of the challenge.

### Project 4 Stock market prediction using Graph Neural Network

#### ***Context***

This project is the master thesis to conclude my double degree between Centrale Lille and Escola Politecnica de São Paulo. This project is currently in progress.

#### ***Our objectives***

The goal is to explore the relevance of using Graph Neural Networks to predict the Brazilian stock market and compare it to baselines made by other students.
